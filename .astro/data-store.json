Jesus Posada here,","I have been a software developer for the last 10+ years, working for Colombian and American companies — quite a few adventures in this industry.\n\nThe most important lesson I've learned is that I spent almost all those years on what I consider the slowest path for my career. Working as a senior developer in Colombian traditional industry meant operating in environments where they cared more about speed than quality, and burned the team out in the process — resulting in software that looked right but was a mess inside.\n\nAfter years of constant restarts and changes — different technologies, non-standardized practices, different philosophies (if any), micro management and lack of innovation — I burned out. Impostor syndrome settled in hard. And the worst part was not knowing whether the problem was the industry around me or something lacking in me.\n\nSo I left to find out. When I started working for American companies, I did it for my self-challenging spirit and my deep desire to improve. I encountered a truly global and standardized industry — highly competitive, organized, and well-prepared. It was a huge challenge. I thought I had succeeded, but with time I understood I was more worried about appearing competitive than deeply understanding all the philosophical and practical changes I was facing. I had escaped the chaos, but I was still running on the same anxious energy.\n\nThat's why I've made a deliberate shift in perspective. I am deconstructing myself as a professional — not just revisiting tools and technologies, but architectures, mindsets, and structures rather than buzzword-heavy language. My 10+ years of real-world experience don't disappear in that process; they give me a well founded context to keep ahead.\n\nIn practice, this means I am focused on a fullstack JavaScript perspective, with a growing focus on Rust — Linux, best practices, structure first, and a logical/mathematical approach to problem-solving. I am taking my time to do this right.\nIf that's the kind of developer you want building your product, I'd love to talk.","src/content/about/about.md","9dc7632d91965e5c",{"html":18,"metadata":19},"\u003Cp>I have been a software developer for the last 10+ years, working for Colombian and American companies — quite a few adventures in this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that I spent almost all those years on what I consider the slowest path for my career.
