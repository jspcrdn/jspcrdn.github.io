title: Hi! Jesus Posada here,

Fullstack JavaScript developer. FLOSS believer. Currently deconstructing myself to build something better.

I've spent 10+ years learning what NOT to do. Along the way I burned out, reset, and figured out what actually matters: clean architecture, sustainable pace, and never stopping questioning.

What if a developer's biggest strength wasn't what they knew — but what they were willing to unlearn?
